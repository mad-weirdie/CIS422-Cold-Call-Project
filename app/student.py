Script Name:    Student Class

Description:    The Student Class for the CoolCall Program.
                This module stores data about an individual student, and keeps
                track of when they have been called on.

class Student:
	"""
	A class to represent a single student in a course.
	
	Attributes
	============================================================================
	first_name, last_name, UO_ID, email_address, phonetic_spelling
		The corresponding information about the student, stored as a string

	reveal_code
		If the student will be included on-deck. 0 means the student will be
		included, another number means the student will not be included.

	total_num_flags
		The number of times a student has "flagged" when called on.

	dates_called
		A list of datetime objects, one for each date/time that a student has 
		been cold called..

	Methods
	============================================================================
	call_on(flag)
		Records that the student was called on during the current day, and
		increments the number of times the student has been called on (with a
		flag if flagged=True).

	get_name()
		Returns a formatted string of the student

	include_on_deck()
		Returns a boolean: is this student marked to be included on-deck?

	This class supports comparison for equality, and can be hashed to use in a
	Python set.
