Script Name:    Constants and Numerical Parameters

Description:    We have located numerical parameters and keystroke/button assignments 
                to this source code file. They are easily changeable by a programmer during 
                development and maintenance of the code.

# Global variable for the number of students the instructor would like to have
# "on deck" from the queue at any given time.
import os.path

# NOTE: If NUM_ON_DECK is >= queue_size, then the # of students on-deck will be set to == queue_size.
#       This is handled in the get_on_deck() function in student_queue.py

# Don't insert students back into the queue at a certain percentage of the head.
# NOTE: If the INSERT_DELAY value is such that a student can possibly be reinserted into an on-deck position,
#       (that is, if INSERT_DELAY < (NUM_ON_DECK / queue_size)), then INSERT_DELAY will be set to (NUM_ON_DECK / queue_size).
#       This is handled in the randomized_enqueue() function in student_queue.py

# The key symbols are detailed in the Tkinter specifications,
# and can be referenced here: https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/keysyms.html
# A more human-readable table of common keys and their corresponding
