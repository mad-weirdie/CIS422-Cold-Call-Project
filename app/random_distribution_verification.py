Script Name:    Random Distrubtion Verification Mode

Description:    The system admin or instructor may enter this mode to verify that
                the queue randomization functionality is working properly. This is
                to ensure that students are cold called at an even rate compared to
                other students.

    A class for operating Random Distribution Verification Mode.
    This mode is meant to restart the program 100 times, and issue
    100 random cold calls each time the program restarts (10,000 total 
    cold calls).

    In order to simulate a pseudo-restart of the program, we call the
    shuffle_front_and_back() method on the test queue. This effect is
    consistent with actually restarting the program.

    All 10,000 cold calls are recorded in a separate log file called
    'random_distribution_verification.txt'. 
    
    Then, an additional summary file is created called 'RDV_summary.txt'.
    
    The summary file shows the amount oftimes each student was cold called 
    during the most recent RDV run, while the log file shows a list of all 
    cold calls in order. Both output files are overwritten by every RDV run.
