Script Name:    Student Queue Class

Description:    The Student Queue Class for the CoolCall Program.
                This module is responsible for maintaining a queue of students,
                to ensure equitable cold-calling.
				
				The front of the queue represents the students who are on-deck.
				When a student is called on, the student is removed from that 
				location in the queue. They are then inserted into the back
				part of the queue, allowing the students in between to shift down.

Authors:        Arden Butterfield, Madison Werries, Amy Reichold,
                Quinn Fetrow, and Derek Martin

class StudentQueue:
	"""
	A class to represent a queue of students taking a course.
	
	There are two ways we can load a queue at startup: 
	- It can be created fresh from a StudentRoster.
	- Or, it can be loaded from a stored pickle file (which is preferable, since the 
	  order of students in the queue will be saved in the pickle file) 
	
	Attributes
	============================================================================
	student_queue[]
		A list of Student objects, for storing the students in the order that 
		they will be added to the on-deck display.

	Methods
	============================================================================
	queue_from_roster(roster)
		Fills out the queue from a StudentRoster object.
	load_queue_from_file(filename)
		Load a saved queue from a pickle file.
	save_queue_to_file(filename)
		Save a queue to a pickle file.
	get_on_deck()
		Get a list of the Students who are currently on-deck
	shuffle_queue()
		Randomly shuffle the entire queue.
	shuffle_front_and_back()
		Shuffle the front and back of the queue separately. This occurs at the
		start of a lecture.
	take_off_deck(student)
		Remove a Student from on deck, and re-insert the student into the queue.
	randomized_enqueue(student)
		Insert a Student into a random position in the back portion of the queue.
	dequeue_student(student)
		Remove a specific Student from the queue.
	queue_size()
		Return the number of students in the queue.
	print_queue(), print_on_deck()
		Debugging methods for printing a list of students that are stored in the queue 
		and on deck.
