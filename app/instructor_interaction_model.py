Script Name:    Instructor Interaction Model

Description:    The main controller for the CoolCall Program.
                This module is the main driver responding to actions from the
                user. This includes receiving keyboard input, and calling the
                StudentQueue to remove/re-add students from the Queue based
                on this input. This module is also responsible for importing
                and exporting student data roster files.

Authors:        EnterPrize Labs:
                Arden Butterfield, Madison Werries, Amy Reichold,
                Quinn Fetrow, and Derek Martin

class InstructorInteractionModel:
    """
    A class to manage the fundamental logic of the system, and run 
    various parts of the application by calling their respective functions.

    Attributes
    =======================================================================
    index
        the index of the currently selected student in the on deck display. For
        instance, if the student furthest to the left was selected, this would
        be the integer 0.

    Methods
    =======================================================================
    ensure_directories_exist()
        Verify that specified directories exist.

    initial_loads()
        Called upon start-up: this function loads data into the queue and roster
        objects.

    _initial_load_roster()
        If the roster is not found in the internal storage location, or if the stored
        roster is not parseable, the system continues to prompt the user to import a 
        roster until one is successfully imported.

    _initial_load_queue()
        Load a queue into memory, either by loading it from the internal pickle
        file, or by creating a new queue from the roster. 

    shift_index()
        Called by key presses: this function shifts the index of the currently
        selected on-deck student in order to select a new student.

    remove()
        Called by key presses: this function removes the selected student from
        on-deck, fascilitating a cold call.

    import_roster()
        Called if the user presses the import roster button, or upon start-up of 
        the program if there is no roster found by the system. Prompts the user to
        import a roster, notifies the user if the selected roster is not formatted
        correctly, and imports the roster into the system. 

    export_roster()
        Prompts user to select a directory, and exports the currently-loaded 
        roster file to that directory.

    _format_names()
        Helper function for import_roster(): formats the names of a list of
        Student objects.
